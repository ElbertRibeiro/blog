As a developer, whether you’re a beginner or a senior, you’ve probably come across the following situation: in a certain
project, you’ve set up all the necessary dependencies and development environment for the project, but you’re not alone
in this task. There are two more people in the project with you, but they can’t or take too long to set up the
environment, either due to package incompatibilities with the chosen language or differences between operating systems.
That’s where Gitpod comes in, a tool that some developers still don’t know about.

What is Gitpod?

It is a cloud-based development environment, but unlike other environments, you create a workspace with all the
necessary installations and configurations, including the use of the terminal.

How does it work?

By logging in with your GitHub account at https://www.gitpod.io/, you automatically have access to your repositories, or
even third-party repositories. Following the instructions on gitpod.io, a browser tab is opened for environment
configuration, and from there, you just code. You can create complete project structures, local servers with Node.js or
Django, and many other things.

What is it used for?

In addition to being able to share the workspace with anyone, avoiding the stress of setting up the environment and
focusing only on coding the project.
